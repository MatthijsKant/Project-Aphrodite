# Project-Aphrodite
In this project, a series of interviews were conducted to determine the viability of a new innovation in the current market. The innovation is called 'Project Aphrodite' and serves to reduce overhead costs and increase customer satisfaction for make-up product outlets. The service is offered in the form of a free downloadable application available on all major platforms, such as iOS and Android. This application allows the user to create a ultra-realistic 3D profile using FaceID technology. This model enables the convenient testing of select makeup products and combinations, creating and downloading popular designs to sample 'looks,' and provides a highly personalized, streamlined purchasing process for the consumer.
